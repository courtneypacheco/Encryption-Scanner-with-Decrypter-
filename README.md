Encryption-Scanner-with-Decrypter-
==================================

This repository contains two programs. One of the programs scans a single-paged document and encrypts the bytes of that document. The other program decrypts the encrypted bytes.

In order to run these programs, you will need to have the following installed on your computer:

1. SANE
2. Pillow
3. Pycrypto
